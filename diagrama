A detailed entity-relationship diagram (ERD) for an e-commerce database. It should include tables for Users, Products, Orders, Order Items, and Payments. The diagram should show relationships between these entities: Users can have many Orders, Orders can have many Order Items, Order Items link to Products, and Payments are linked to Orders. Each table should have its attributes, such as User (id_user, name, email, password), Product (id_product, name, description, price, stock), Order (id_order, user_id, date, status), Order Item (id_item_order, order_id, product_id, quantity, price), and Payment (id_payment, order_id, payment_method, status, amount). The diagram should be clear, with arrows indicating relationships and foreign key constraints.
